To run our program:
* open up a terminal window and navigate to the folder ...
* * If you use windows you can open the folder in file explorer and type 'cmd' in the file path, which will open 
    the command prompt already opened in the correct folder
* type 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
* open some more terminal window navigated to the folder ... you will need
* * One terminal to run the server
* * One terminal to observe and interact with the bots
* * One terminal for each bot
* to start the server type 'python3 rest_server.py'
* to start the bots type 'python3 client.py -b [BOTNAME]'
* * Bot names are Bertram, Carlton, Bobby, Elvira and Joe
* * Bot names are not case-sensitive 
* * The bots will register, create a room, join rooms and send messages by themselves
* To interact with the program as a user type 'python3 client.py'
* * -b is an optional argument, as bots use the regular client program
* * just start typing in the terminal, and you will get some helpful messages
